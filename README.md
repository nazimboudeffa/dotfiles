# Installation

Basically I have made sh script to make everything automatically but, I have some issues

I use Ubuntu Server

## OH MY ZSH

Install zsh

`sudo apt install zsh`

Go to https://ohmyz.sh/ and click on Install oh-my-zsh

Then you'll have this command because I use Ubuntu Server and that curl is not installed by default

`sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"`

Do you want to change your default shell to zsh, type Y and press enter

## VIM
